# How to Conduct a JTBD Interview

This guide walks you through conducting a Jobs to Be Done "switch interview" to understand why people hire and fire products.

## Prerequisites

- Access to someone who recently switched to or from a product/solution
- 45-60 minutes of uninterrupted time
- Recording capability (with permission)
- Note-taking setup

## Steps

### 1. Find the Right Participant

Interview people who recently (within 3 months) made a switch:
- Started using your product
- Stopped using your product
- Switched from a competitor

**Avoid**: People who are "considering" or "might" switch. You need actual decisions.

### 2. Set Up the Interview

**Script to schedule:**
> "I'm researching how people make decisions about [product category]. I'd love to hear the story of how you ended up using [product]. It'll take about 45 minutes and help us build better products."

**Don't say**: "I want feedback on our product" (biases responses toward features).

### 3. Start with the Timeline

Begin at the end and work backward:

```
"Tell me about when you first started using [new product]."
↓
"What were you using before that?"
↓
"When did you first realize the old solution wasn't working?"
↓
"What happened that made you start looking for something new?"
```

### 4. Explore the Four Forces

For each phase, probe the forces:

| Force | Questions to Ask |
|-------|------------------|
| **Push** | "What frustrated you about the old way?" "What was the breaking point?" |
| **Pull** | "What attracted you to [new solution]?" "What did you hope it would do?" |
| **Anxiety** | "What concerns did you have about switching?" "What almost stopped you?" |
| **Habit** | "What was comfortable about the old way?" "What did you miss after switching?" |

### 5. Dig for Specifics

When they give general answers, ask for specific instances:

| They Say | You Ask |
|----------|---------|
| "It was too slow" | "Can you remember a specific time when that slowed you down?" |
| "I needed something better" | "What happened that made you feel that way?" |
| "My colleague recommended it" | "What specifically did they say? Where were you when they told you?" |

### 6. Map the Timeline

Create a timeline of the decision:

```
FIRST THOUGHT → PASSIVE LOOKING → ACTIVE LOOKING → DECISION → FIRST USE
     │               │                 │              │           │
   Event           Event             Event          Event       Event
   Date            Date              Date           Date        Date
```

### 7. Identify the Job

From the interview, synthesize:

```
When [situation they described],
I want to [what they were trying to accomplish],
So I can [the outcome they hoped for].
```

### 8. Key Questions Checklist

**First thought**:
- [ ] "When did you first realize you might need something different?"
- [ ] "What was happening in your life/work at that time?"

**Passive looking**:
- [ ] "How did you first hear about alternatives?"
- [ ] "Were you actively looking, or did you stumble on it?"

**Active looking**:
- [ ] "What triggered you to seriously start evaluating options?"
- [ ] "What criteria mattered most?"
- [ ] "Who else was involved in the decision?"

**Decision moment**:
- [ ] "What made you finally commit?"
- [ ] "What almost made you not switch?"
- [ ] "How did you feel right after deciding?"

**First use**:
- [ ] "What was your experience when you first used it?"
- [ ] "What surprised you?"
- [ ] "What didn't work as expected?"

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Instead |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Asking about features | Gets rational justification, not real motivation | Ask about situations and feelings |
| Accepting first answer | Surface answers hide real jobs | Probe: "Tell me more about that" |
| Leading questions | Biases toward your assumptions | Use open questions: "What happened next?" |
| Skipping the timeline | Misses the decision context | Always reconstruct the journey |

## Expected Output

After the interview, you should have:
- A timeline of the decision process
- Clear push and pull factors
- Identified anxieties and habits
- A job statement describing what they were trying to accomplish
- Quotes you can reference later
