# How to Create a Journey Map

This guide walks you through creating a user journey map to visualize the complete experience around a goal.

## Prerequisites

- A specific persona or user type
- A goal or scenario to map
- Research data (interviews, observations, or informed assumptions to validate)
- Whiteboard, sticky notes, or digital tool (Miro, FigJam, etc.)

## Steps

### 1. Define Scope

Before mapping, clarify boundaries:

| Decision | Options |
|----------|---------|
| **Persona** | Which user type? (Pick one) |
| **Scenario** | What are they trying to accomplish? |
| **Scope** | Full journey or specific segment? |
| **Type** | Current state, future state, or day-in-the-life? |

**Example scope:**
> Persona: Marketing Manager (Sarah)
> Scenario: Planning and booking a team offsite
> Scope: From first considering an offsite to day-after follow-up
> Type: Current state

### 2. Set Up Your Canvas

Create rows for each layer:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ PERSONA: [Name]                                                  │
│ SCENARIO: [What they're trying to accomplish]                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ PHASES      │        │        │        │        │              │
├─────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────────┤
│ ACTIONS     │        │        │        │        │              │
├─────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────────┤
│ THOUGHTS    │        │        │        │        │              │
├─────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────────┤
│ EMOTIONS    │        │        │        │        │              │
├─────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────────┤
│ TOUCHPOINTS │        │        │        │        │              │
├─────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────────┤
│ PAIN POINTS │        │        │        │        │              │
├─────────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────────┤
│ OPPORTUN.   │        │        │        │        │              │
└─────────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴────────┴──────────────┘
```

### 3. Identify Phases

Break the journey into major stages. Read left to right as time:

**Common phase patterns:**

| Journey Type | Typical Phases |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Purchase** | Awareness → Consideration → Decision → Onboarding → Use |
| **Task completion** | Trigger → Research → Execute → Complete → Follow-up |
| **Service** | Discover → Engage → Deliver → Support → Renew |

**For our offsite example:**
```
Research → Compare → Propose → Book → Coordinate → Execute → Follow-up
```

### 4. Fill in Actions

For each phase, list what the user does:

| Phase | Actions |
|-------|---------|
| Research | Search "team offsite venues", ask colleagues, browse Instagram |
| Compare | Visit 3-4 venue websites, check reviews, email for quotes |
| Propose | Create comparison doc, present to manager, get approval |

**Tip**: Use verbs. "Google search" not "Research phase."

### 5. Capture Thoughts

What's going through their mind? Use first person and quotes:

| Phase | Thoughts |
|-------|----------|
| Research | "Where do I even start?" "How much is too much to spend?" |
| Compare | "These all look the same" "How do I know which is actually good?" |
| Propose | "Will my boss think this is too expensive?" |

**Tip**: Include worries, questions, and hopes—not just neutral observations.

### 6. Map Emotions

Rate emotional state at each phase. Use a simple scale or emoji:

```
😊 Positive
😐 Neutral  
😟 Concerned
😰 Frustrated
😊 Relieved
```

**Draw an emotion line** connecting the points to visualize the journey's emotional arc.

### 7. List Touchpoints

Where do they interact with systems, people, or content?

| Category | Examples |
|----------|----------|
| **Digital** | Website, app, email, chatbot |
| **Human** | Sales call, support chat, colleague |
| **Physical** | Store, printed material, product |
| **Third-party** | Review sites, social media, search engines |

**Note which touchpoints you control** vs. ones you don't.

### 8. Identify Pain Points

Look for friction, frustration, and failure:

| Signal | Questions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Effort** | Where do they work harder than necessary? |
| **Wait** | Where do they have to wait? |
| **Confusion** | Where do they get lost or unsure? |
| **Anxiety** | Where do they worry about making mistakes? |
| **Switching** | Where do they have to change tools/contexts? |

### 9. Spot Opportunities

For each pain point, brainstorm potential solutions:

| Pain Point | Opportunity |
|------------|-------------|
| "Too many options, hard to compare" | Comparison tool, curated recommendations |
| "Manual copy-paste into proposal" | Exportable comparison, proposal templates |
| "No confirmation after booking" | Instant confirmation, progress tracker |

### 10. Validate and Iterate

Your first map is a hypothesis. Validate it:

| Method | What It Tests |
|--------|---------------|
| **User interviews** | Are phases, actions, emotions accurate? |
| **Analytics** | Do people actually follow this path? |
| **Support data** | Are identified pain points real issues? |
| **Observation** | Watch someone go through the journey |

Update the map as you learn.

## Journey Map Checklist

- [ ] Single, specific persona
- [ ] Clear scenario and scope
- [ ] Phases flow left to right chronologically
- [ ] Actions are specific and verifiable
- [ ] Thoughts are in first person
- [ ] Emotions charted across journey
- [ ] Touchpoints identify what you control vs. don't
- [ ] Pain points are specific, not generic
- [ ] Opportunities are actionable

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Multiple personas | Muddles insights | One map per persona |
| Inside-out perspective | Describes your process, not user's | Use "I" language from user's view |
| Too high-level | "Research phase" tells you nothing | Break into specific actions |
| Skipping emotions | Misses the why behind behavior | Add emotional layer |
| Static document | Gets outdated, unused | Review quarterly, update with new data |
